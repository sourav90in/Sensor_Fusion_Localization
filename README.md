# Sensor_Fusion_Localization
Sensor Fusion for Localization- Kalman Filtering

This Repository has been organized as follows:

1. Extended Kalman Filtering for Locaization of an object of interest combining LIDAR and RADAR Data.
2. Unscented Kalman Filtering for Localization of an object of interestcombining LIDAR and RADAR Data.
3. Particle Filtering for Localization of the self-driving car using Map landmarks.
